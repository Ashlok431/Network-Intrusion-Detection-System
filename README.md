# Network-Intrusion-Detection-System
This project implements a Machine Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) to classify malicious and benign network traffic. It uses publicly available benchmark datasets — CICIDS 2017, CICIDS 2018, and UNSW-NB15 — to train and evaluate multiple classifiers.

🚀 Features
Applied supervised ML algorithms: Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, and MLP.

Performed data preprocessing, feature selection, and class balancing (using SMOTE).

Achieved up to 99.9% accuracy on CICIDS datasets.

Evaluation metrics include: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.

Built and tested the pipeline using Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Google Colab.
